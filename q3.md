# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. Is there any way of getting all the data from a collection?
Yes, you can retrieve all the data from a collection in Qdrant using the appropriate API endpoint. 
Typically, you would use a search query with no specific conditions to retrieve all documents from the collection. Here's how you can achieve this using Qdrant's gRPC API:

`rust`
```
use qdrant_client::{Client, Query};

fn main() {
    // Initialize Qdrant client
    let client = Client::new("localhost:6334");

    // Construct a query to retrieve all documents
    let query = Query::new();

    // Execute the query
    match client.search(query) {
        Ok(result) => {
            // Process search result
            println!("Search result: {:?}", result);
        }
        Err(e) => {
            // Handle error
            eprintln!("Error performing search: {:?}", e);
        }
    }
}
```

## In this code:
* We initialize a Qdrant client connected to the server running on `localhost:6334`.
* We construct a query with no specific conditions, which effectively retrieves all documents from the collection.
* We execute the query using the client's `search()` method.
* If successful, the search result will contain all documents from the collection.

## 2.  I am unable to connect to the qdrant APIs on port 443 either over Postman or PHP Curl. However, if I use curl via. terminal it works fine. Any idea? 
If you're experiencing issues connecting to the Qdrant APIs on port 443 using tools like Postman or PHP cURL, but it works fine when using cURL via terminal, 
it's likely due to differences in configurations or settings between these tools.

Here are a few things you can check and try:

1. **SSL/TLS Settings**: Ensure that your client applications (Postman and PHP cURL) are configured to use SSL/TLS correctly when connecting to port 443. Sometimes, there might be issues related to certificate verification or cipher suites.
2. **Firewall or Network Settings**: Check if there are any firewall rules or network settings blocking outbound connections on port 443 for your client applications. If possible, try connecting from a different network to see if the issue persists.
3. **Proxy Settings**: If you're behind a proxy server, make sure that your client applications are configured to use the correct proxy settings when connecting to port 443.
4. **Headers and Options**: Compare the headers and options being sent by cURL in terminal with those sent by Postman or PHP cURL. There might be differences in the request that could cause the server to respond differently.
5. **Error Messages**: Check if there are any error messages or logs provided by Postman or PHP cURL when attempting to connect to port 443. This could provide clues about what might be going wrong.
6. **Versions and Updates**: Ensure that your client applications are up to date with the latest versions. Sometimes, issues related to connections or SSL/TLS handling are fixed in newer versions of the software.

## 3. I am trying to use qdrant js rest client on AWS Lambda, however I get the following error when importing the package:
```
2024-01-28T11:04:26.920Z undefined ERROR Uncaught Exception {"errorType":"Error","errorMessage":"Dynamic require of "assert" is not supported","stack":["Error: Dynamic require of "assert"
is not supported"," at file:///var/task/index.mjs:13:9"," at node_modules/undici/lib/client.js (file:///var/task/index.mjs:6348:18)"," at require2 (file:///var/task/index.mjs:16:50)","

```
## Looks like it might be an issue with undici dependency. Any idea how to get this to work?
The error message you're encountering suggests that the AWS Lambda environment does not support dynamic requires, which is required by the undici dependency used by the qdrant js rest client.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Transpile to CommonJS**: If you're using ES modules (.mjs files), try transpiling your code to CommonJS (.js files). AWS Lambda environments typically support CommonJS modules. You can use a tool like Babel to transpile your code.
2. **Bundle Dependencies**: Bundle your dependencies along with your code using a tool like Webpack or Browserify. This ensures that all dependencies are included in a single file, avoiding any dynamic requires that might cause issues in the Lambda environment.
3. **Check Compatibility**: Verify if undici is compatible with the AWS Lambda environment. Sometimes, certain dependencies might not work well in serverless environments due to various limitations.
4. **Use Compatible Libraries**: If undici is causing compatibility issues, consider using a different HTTP client library that is known to work well in AWS Lambda environments.
5. **Debugging**: Review your code and dependencies to ensure that there are no other dynamic requires that might cause issues in the Lambda environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and use the qdrant js rest client in your AWS Lambda function. If you continue to encounter problems, you may need to seek further assistance from the qdrant community or AWS support.
