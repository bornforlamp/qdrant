# 2. Could you please extract from our public discord 1-2 examples for common problems and provide code snippets that could help customers next time

## 1. Hi, this is my first time here. I'm considering using Quadrant and would like to start with InMemory, similar to Python:

```
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
qdrant = QdrantClient(":memory:") # Create an in-memory Qdrant instance for testing, CI/CD
```

`OR`

```
client = QdrantClient(path="path/to/db")  # Persist changes to disk for fast prototyping
```

## What would be the equivalent in Rust? Do I also need to import the qdrant server?
In Rust, you would typically create an in-memory or persistent Qdrant instance using the qdrant-client crate. Here's how you can achieve that:
First, add `qdrant-client` to your `Cargo.toml` file:
<br>

`toml`
```
[dependencies]
qdrant-client = "0.5.0"
```
Then, you can use the following code to create an in-memory or persistent Qdrant instance:

`rust`
```
use qdrant_client::{Client, Config};

fn main() {
    // Create an in-memory Qdrant instance
    let client = Client::new(Config::new_in_memory());

    // OR

    // Create a persistent Qdrant instance
    let client = Client::new(Config::new("path/to/db"));

    // Now you can use `client` to interact with the Qdrant server
}
```

This code creates a Qdrant client instance `(client)` with either in-memory or persistent storage, depending on the configuration provided.


## 2. Hi I'm getting the following error when trying to match any on a field that is an array of tags (strings):

```
[!] status: InvalidArgument, message: "Malformed Match condition", details: [], metadata: MetadataMap
{ headers: {"server": "awselb/2.0", "date": "Tue, 28 Mar 2023 14:38:53 GMT", "content-type": "application/grpc", "content-length": "0"} }
```

## The dump of the filter used:

```
QDRANT_FILTER: Some(Filter { should: [], must: [Condition { condition_one_of: Some(Field(FieldCondition
{ key: "tags", r#match: Some(Match { match_value: Some(Keywords(RepeatedStrings { strings: ["issue-55", "issue-56"] })) }),
range: None, geo_bounding_box: None, geo_radius: None, values_count: None })) }], must_not: [Condition { condition_one_of:
Some(Field(FieldCondition { key: "tags", r#match: Some(Match { match_value: Some(Keywords(RepeatedStrings { strings: ["issue-62"] })) }),
range: None, geo_bounding_box: None, geo_radius: None, values_count: None })) }] })
```

## Any idea what might be the cause? I've assumed that match any is implemented by Keywords `match_value`

It seems like you're trying to perform a search query using Qdrant's gRPC API, specifically using the Match condition to match any of the specified tags in an array field. 
The error message indicates that there's an issue with the format or content of the match condition.
Here's a basic example of how you might construct a query using Qdrant's gRPC API in Rust to match any of the specified tags in an array field:

```
use qdrant_client::{Client, Query};

fn main() {
    // Initialize Qdrant client
    let client = Client::new("localhost:6334");

    // Define the tags to match
    let tags_to_match = vec!["issue-55", "issue-56"];

    // Define the tags to exclude
    let tags_to_exclude = vec!["issue-62"];

    // Construct the query
    let query = Query::new()
        .with_should("tags", tags_to_match)
        .with_must_not("tags", tags_to_exclude);

    // Execute the query
    match client.search(query) {
        Ok(result) => {
            // Process search result
            println!("Search result: {:?}", result);
        }
        Err(e) => {
            // Handle error
            eprintln!("Error performing search: {:?}", e);
        }
    }
}
```
In this example:
1. We initialize a Qdrant client connected to the server running on `localhost:6334`.
2. We define the tags to match `(issue-55 and issue-56)` and the tags to exclude `(issue-62)`.
3. We construct a query using `Query::new()` and add conditions using `with_should()` and `with_must_not()` methods.
4. Finally, we execute the query using the client's `search()` method and handle the result or any errors encountered.
<br>
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies (qdrant-client) added to your Cargo.toml file and that your Qdrant server is running and accessible at the specified address (localhost:6334) in this case).
