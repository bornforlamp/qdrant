# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is there any way of getting all the data from a collection?
Yes, you can retrieve all the data from a collection in Qdrant using the appropriate API endpoint. 
Typically, you would use a search query with no specific conditions to retrieve all documents from the collection. Here's how you can achieve this using Qdrant's gRPC API:

```
use qdrant_client::{Client, Query};

fn main() {
    // Initialize Qdrant client
    let client = Client::new("localhost:6334");

    // Construct a query to retrieve all documents
    let query = Query::new();

    // Execute the query
    match client.search(query) {
        Ok(result) => {
            // Process search result
            println!("Search result: {:?}", result);
        }
        Err(e) => {
            // Handle error
            eprintln!("Error performing search: {:?}", e);
        }
    }
}
```

## In this code:
* We initialize a Qdrant client connected to the server running on localhost:6334.
* We construct a query with no specific conditions, which effectively retrieves all documents from the collection.
* We execute the query using the client's search() method.

## If successful, the search result will contain all documents from the collection.
